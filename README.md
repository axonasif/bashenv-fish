# bashenv.fish

A faster alternative of [bass](https://github.com/edc/bass) with no dependencies.

Currently it only loads `bash` interactive environment variables inside `fish`.

If I do come around with the need of using something like `pyenv` and such other tools that needs to alter the current shell session for some extra functionality, I might look into implementing a method for interacting with them natively from `fish`.

# Installation

Install with [Fisher](https://github.com/jorgebucaran/fisher):

```console
fisher install axonasif/bashenv.fish
```
